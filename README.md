# Zoo-data-analysis
Created Exploratory Analysis using the data (histogram, correlation matrix). Applied different models for analysis such as linear regression with LASSO penalty, Cross-Validation, SVM, KNN, and MLP classification and compared the accuracy and precision of each model.
There are many different names in animal names, so I think it is appropriate to take class type as the response variable and others as the predictor variable.
